# maintainability


cppfuncfinder = finds operators for each language. If you want to find something else either, just add It's regex that terms in rule of regex.
cyclomaticComplexity = works like key finder. write keys that you want to find into the array of which language you're using. Prints cyclomatic complexity


MaintainabilityIndex.js
This program is finds Maintainability index of code. Independent from comments, It calculates halstead metrics, cyclomatic complexity by the help of cpp programs. 
In javascript, Regex is just matching only the first word in a row. Thats why I thought I need to write a cpp program to actualize this regex. Same regex worked clear in cpp program.


Command: node .\MaintainabilityIndex.js <id> <language (cpp,js,py)> <b64 encoded code in js,cpp,py>

If you launch firstly, It'll compile the cpp programs. thats why you'll get wrong answers. After launching program once, It'll give you true results.
